#Short Answer Questions:

###What is the difference between an API and a server?
APIs, or application program interfaces, are essentially building blocks to follow when building software applications, that allow developers to access the protocols of an existing database or application.  Servers, on the other hand, revolve around visualizing and diagramming where messages and data will go.  Their main role is to provide data to a client, which can sometimes be in the form of accessing an API.

###What does a DNS server do when you type "www.google.com" into an address bar?
A DNS server translates the domain name you typed in the address bar into an IP address to grab the relevant server and its data.

###What are some differences between a single page application and a multipage application? List one example of each.
Single page applications are essentially web apps that do not require to the browser to refresh, whereas multiple page applications will cause the browser to refresh each time a link is clicked.

###Why do we use RESTful routes?
The acronym REST stands for "Representational State Transfer."  This concept involves the naming of the routes provided by a server in a manner that makes hitting an API more intuitive.

###What is an API key and why are they used?
API Keys are personal identification numbers distributed by the developer of an API, in order to monitor access to the services provided.  This way, the developer has the option of handing out keys and therefore limiting the use of their API when they feel appropriate.
